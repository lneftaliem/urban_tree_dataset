# urban_tree_dataset
A North American urban tree spatial dataset


**Background**

Urban areas face significant environmental challenges driven by anthropogenic influences, as urban landscapes are often characterized by air and noise pollution, habitat loss, and heat island effects. Previous research suggests that urban trees help to mitigate the consequences of urban dwelling. However, the lack of comprehensive spatial information on urban trees at a large-scale has hindered research progress, particularly in quantifying the numerous benefits that urban trees provide, such as carbon storage and air purification. Thus, quantifying urban ecological mechanisms requires a spatially explicit urban tree dataset. While many cities have local urban tree inventories available, there is no large-scale urban tree dataset with spatially explicit information and tree characteristics currently available, which is essential for accurately quantifying carbon storage. _Here, we developed a new North American dataset by leveraging local urban tree inventories from 30 cities across the United States and Canada, capturing over 4.7 million urban trees with standardized measurement systems and tree species names._ We anticipate that the development of a robust, publicly available dataset can facilitate the exploration of large-scale urban ecological dynamics.





**Within the dataset:**

  country: country of inventoried data
  
  state: state of inventoried data
  
  city: city of inventoried data
  
  year: year inventory was completed or appended
  
  long: longitude; projected on EPSG:4326
  
  lat: latitude; projected on EPSG:4326
  
  species_botanical_name: scientific genus and species name of inventoried tree

  species_common_name: common name of inventoried tree
  
  dbh: collected in centimeters at approx. 4.5 feet



_Supplementary info: scientifc species and common names are available in spp_codes_final file and the cleaning code for each data set is available as final_utd_code._
